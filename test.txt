In our lab, we were tasked with deciding between two substances, ammonium chloride and
ammonium nitrate to make a system capable of cooling a drinks can by 5 degrees celsius. We deliberated
on which substance to go with, when we found out that ammonium nitrate is shock sensitive to aluminum,
effectively making it an explosive which immediately disqualified it from qualification. Receiving
confirmation from our lab TA, we began calculating how much ammonium chloride we’d need and the
theoretical amount can be seen in the table above in the Design and Best Results for your Proposed
Product section as well as in the appendix in our sample calculations.
We attempted 2 trials, once with 13.28g of ammonium chloride and another with 15.01g (our best
trial whose information is laid out in the table above). We found that with 15.01g of ammonium chloride,
the temperature of the water inside the can dropped by 5.4 degrees celsius in less than 3 minutes. The
table may say the Time for Temperature Change was 3 minutes, but that was just simply how long we
measured the temperature for, the temperature stabilized at 20.1 °C roughly 2 minutes and 15 seconds.
Nonetheless, this time is well within the 5 minute limit the contract stated, so it is safe to say our product
was incredibly successful. It was successful as well as it fell in the constraints given to us. The solubility
of ammonium chloride is 37.2g / 100g of water, and 15.01g is well under that threshold. The cost is a bit
of an issue, coming out to $1.87 every time you want to cool your drink, but we can’t do much to change
that seeing that the rate is fixed.
We decided not to take the first trial into account because we didn’t measure the initial
temperature correctly. We were told to agitate the crucible to get the ammonium chloride to fully dissolve
in the surrounding water, and thus allow for maximum heat transfer. We mistakenly began agitating,
thereby speeding up the reaction, before we could get an initial reading of the water temperature inside
the can. Thus, there was only a 3.2 °C drop in temperature over 173 seconds. We estimated that the actual
initial temperature was 28 °C, but that’s incredibly unreliable so we decided to not use that trial in proving
the functionality of our product.
No experiment is without its flaws, and the same can be said for this lab. There’s a couple of
instances that could’ve limited/hindered our results. Firstly, we didn’t fully dry out the crucible and the
inside of the can, potentially leaving some water still in both equipment and thus changing the overall
volume of water because we poured in 100.0 mL of water into both. On the topic of measurements
